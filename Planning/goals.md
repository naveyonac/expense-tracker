# MVP 
For our project, our minimum viable product was to have a budgeting tool with fully functional CRUD on one model. We wanted to be able to create, read, update and delete all for either a revenue or an expense.

## Bronze
Our bronze goal is to have a method inside of both our revenue and expens pages that would total up the amounts for each and display them at the bottom. This would allow our app to be more usable by not just showing the items but also calculating the totals for each and displaying them.

### Silver 
Our silver goal is to take our bronze one step further. Once we had totals on each the revenue and expense pages, we want to have a method that will subtract the expense total from the revenue total and have that total displayed on the main page for the user to see. Along with that, we want to add a feature that would allow the user to choose a time period to track. So instead of keeping a running total of all their expenses and revenues, they would select 'monthly' and it would show their expenses and revenues for the last month then calculate the totals on their respective pages.

#### Gold
When it comes to shooting for gold, we want to add a user feature. This would allow a user to sign in and be able to track their specific budget instead of one giant universal one.
